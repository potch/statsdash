this does something off-the-shelf, but need much TLC still.

Each graph in the default graphs list has two required and two optional
keys.

Required:

- `target` - an array of stats to draw

- `title` - a title for the graph

Optional:

- `stacked` - a boolean display a stacked graph (e.g. for server stats
  like memory use) instead of a line graph

- `alpha` - when used with stack, set to a float between 0.0 and 1.0 to
  control the alpha channel of the graph area (e.g. 0.7 lets you see the
  lines behind the graph)
